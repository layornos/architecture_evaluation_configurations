# Architecture Evaluation - Configurations

This repository represents the analysis configurations of rju's "Architecture Evaluation Tool".
Adding the configuration files to the repositories directly is not sufficient for multiple reasons:
1. The configuration is not part of the project itself, thus it would violate the separation of concerns
2. For projects where I have no rights to add files to the repository, would miss the configuration files
